Article examining how airlines were trying to accommodate passengers with disabilities that were unable to wear masks early in the pandemic after airlines had started to require masks be worn on planes.

At the start of the 2025 holiday travel season, the Wall Street Journal wrote a piece on "jetway Jesus," the phenomenon of passengers who needed assistance boarding a flight being able to miraculously walk off the planes. Justin provided a few quotes while author John Walton takes a deeper look at the problems with this narrative, the challenges passengers with disabilities face while flying that may cause them to need assistance, and other related topics.
