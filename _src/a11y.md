## Focus state

I just wanted to take a moment to give a shout out to [Erik Kroes](https://www.erikkroes.nl/) for documenting the [universal focus state pattern](https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/the-universal-focus-state/), which I am using. The only tweak I've made is some color changes to fit the site's color scheme a little better.
