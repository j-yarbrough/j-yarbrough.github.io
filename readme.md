# Readme

## Purpose

This repo is for a personal website/portfolio and is built using [eleventy.](https://www.11ty.dev/)

## Typical workflow

- Issues are logged for to-do items
- Changes are created in their own branches and then merged via pull request. If a PR closes an issue, this will be noted in comments of the PR with "closes #123" where 123 would be the number for the issue. This will automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.
- When PR is merged to main, GitHub actions will perform a build and push those changes to the "gh-pages" branch, which serves the site on GitHub Pages.
- A build will also be triggered at midnight US Central time (GMT -6) to update the copyright year on all pages.

## Redirects

To set up a redirect:

1. Create a new .md file
2. in the front matter, set the following:
    - redirectURL: The URL you wish to redirect to
    - layout: layouts/redirect.njk

## Template variations

There are template variations that can be automatically used based on front matter set in the documents. The front value variables are as follows:

- H1: Allows for the H1 of the page to be separate from the title of the page.
    - If H1 is in front matter, it will be used as the H1 text.
    - If no H1, then the title value will be used.
- noBreadcrumbs: true will exclude breadcrumbs from the page. Note breadcrumbs are not currently available in the base template, but this variable still exists in front matter since it may be brought back.

## .webc components

All .webc components can be found in the _components folder at the root of the project. Components take advantage of CSS/JS bundling where applicable.
